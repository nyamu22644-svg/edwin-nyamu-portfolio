                <h2><i class="fas fa-running"></i> Backyard Olympics</h2>
                <p>Growing up with my twin brother Eric, we transformed our backyard into a competitive arena. We engineered our own high-jump setups that drew neighborhood crowds, fostering a spirit of innovation and friendly rivalry.</p>
                <div class="lab-content">
                    <div class="lab-text">
                        <p>What started as backyard fun became a demonstration of engineering principles. The high jump wasn't just about jumping higher—it was about designing equipment that was safe, adjustable, and exciting for everyone.</p>
                        <p>This experience taught me that innovation happens when creativity meets practicality, a lesson I apply to every software solution I build.</p>
