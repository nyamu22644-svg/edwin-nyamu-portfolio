## Digital Edwin: The AGI Experiment

I'm training a 70B parameter model on Digital Ocean. It's my digital twin—handles routine tasks, scales my output, multiplies my professional reach. Not just an AI; it's a force multiplier for Edgait Solutions.

## The Real-World Hustle

Beyond code, I run a poultry operation in Kutus. Currently managing 100 improved kienyeji chicks. Diversification keeps things grounded—tech and feathers.

## Tech Stack & Deployment

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Portfolio**: Hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Production Apps**: Vercel-powered (DukaBook, Hati)
- **Custom Domain**: [edgaitmdm.tech](https://edgaitmdm.tech) for enterprise solutions

## Founder's Note

I'm building Edgait Solutions to tackle real Kenyan challenges—from transparent finances for small shops via DukaBook to secure health data with Hati. This portfolio isn't a school assignment; it's the roadmap for the next decade.
